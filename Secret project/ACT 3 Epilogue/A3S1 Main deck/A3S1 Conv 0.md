new dialog(Lussie, "Sssss. No. The chapel, the crypt, however you may call it-- it was enigmatic, but harmlessss."),
new dialog(Coati, "Can I see the weapon?"),
new dialog(Lussie, "There you go."),
new dialog(NarratorBeret, "Lussie took out the small, mysterious vial and presented it to Lieutenant Coati. I joined him to take a look at the item."),
new dialog(NarratorBeret, "In the vial was some sort of light blue, transparent liquid. It looked harmless."),

new dialog(Beret, "Do you know what is the purpose of that weapon?"),
new dialog(Bjorn, "I might have an answer to this, but I need to think about it a bit more."),

new dialog(Beret, "I agree. Excellent work. I can only vaguely grasp the importance of such a discovery, but I am sure that our new anthropologist would be thrilled to talk about it."),
new dialog(Bjorn, "Why isn't she on the bridge with us?"),
new dialog(Beret, "She is taking care of other matters in her office."),
new dialog(Beret, "But, I do think it would be a good idea to talk to her."),
new dialog(Coati, "Although we can relax a little bit now that we got our hands on this weapon, we have to discover what it is exactly."),

new dialog(NarratorBeretLussie, "Lussie came out on top of her class in Starfleet Academy. For that reason, she was able to get specialized early-on -- she often takes care of substance analysis and even assists with some of the medical care on the 3MP4-NADA.""),
new dialog(Beret, "Good idea. Then, here are my orders: Lussie, take the vial to the laboratory to analyse its contents. Björn, head to Thaléa's office to share your discoveries with her and see if anything could be useful to uncover the secrets of this vial."),

new dialog(Coati, "Indeed, indeed. I am happy it is to stay on board."),
new dialog(Beret, "This weapon? On my ship? Oh, no. We are heading right now to the nearest safe Star Base to drop it to them. This is too much of a responsibility for the 3MP4-NADA-- we would be immediate targets."),
new dialog(Coati, "The weapon will stay at the Star Base?..."),
new dialog(Beret, "I would assume that they would keep on changing the weapon's location to make sure it never gets into the enemy's hands."),
new dialog(Coati, "Mmh... I see."),
new dialog(Beret, "So... We will just have to keep it safe until we arrive."),
new dialog(Coati, "... It will have to be well protected indeed."),
