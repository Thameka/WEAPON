new dialog(Narrator, "My youngest daughter, Arya, brought me fruits today. She says working in my own tomb is too gloomy. I disagree. I have always enjoyed the quiet of graveyards. Besides, I am not afraid of death: I have already lived more than a hundred years, and I know I still have at least another century to pass."),

How could we be scared of death? Most of us choose to die themselves when they decide they have done everything they wanted to do."),

new dialog(Narrator, "Terra being a planet that has no relationship to the others in its system, it still functions according to a system of nations and borders. The Terran country closest to my heart is the little country of Paraguay."),
