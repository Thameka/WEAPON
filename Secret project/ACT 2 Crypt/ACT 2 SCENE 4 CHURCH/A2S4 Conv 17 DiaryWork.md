new dialog(Narrator, "My name is Zhuraid Uv'air. I am a Necralian researcher. Although my aim was to make discoveries beneficial to society, I might have discovered something terrible instead."),
new dialog(Narrator, "We have uncovered some years ago the beautiful planet of Earth."),
new dialog(Lussie, "Earth?"),
new dialog(Bjorn, "... Interesting. Earth is the former name of Terra."),
new dialog(Lussie, "We had observers long before we reached the ssstars ourssselves..."),
new dialog(Narrator, "This planet is far lusher with life than any planet in the system of Necralis, but it holds a dark truth: its inhabitants all wish to hold power over others. Earth is ravaged by war."),
new dialog(Narrator, "What greatly shocked my compatriots intrigued me. How did they come to this? Even more so, I started to dig into Earthian literature. So did my peers."),
new dialog(Narrator, "There, I found terrifying things. Earthian literature describes dictatorships and weapons, both brutal and sly. My mind started to wander: our peaceful system had never entertained any hostile thoughts before. What if this new trend of Earthian culture planted in our minds the seeds of greed?"),
new dialog(Narrator, "Earthian culture is as beautiful as it is terrible. I decided to develop in secret a weapon that could be used against my own kind in case it decided to hide evil thoughts. Through transparency and trust, all can be achieved."),
new dialog(Narrator, "This weapon I couldn't have imagined myself. Its idea came from a novel of a genre Earthians call dystopia, from a country called Sweden."),

new dialog(new dialog(Narrator, "After years of careful chemical research and trials, I think I have succeeded. I produced one very small sample of the weapon, but it should be easily replicated by any kind of advanced technology. Because of its dangerous nature, it shall remain under lock in my tomb, even after my death."),
new dialog(Narrator, "I shall tell my closest friends and family about this weapon. I shall tell them to spread the news to any one they deem trustworthy, or to any resistant cell in a potential malevolent society. For now, Necralis still thrives in peace and benevolence. But how to resist greed once we realize we can seize power for ourselves?"),
new dialog(Narrator, "The code to the door holding the weapon is LEFT - LEFT - RIGHT - RIGHT - LEFT."),
new dialog(Narrator, "Upon entering the room, you will have to speak with me. I cannot, and will not, give the weapon to someone that cannot be trusted."
new dialog(Bjorn, "I think this is the extent of what we can glean about that weapon."),
new dialog(Lussie, "I don't know what to ssssay."),
new dialog(Bjorn, "How can we talk to him if he's dead?"),
