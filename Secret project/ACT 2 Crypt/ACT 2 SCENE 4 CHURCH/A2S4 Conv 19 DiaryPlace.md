new dialog(Narrator, "You were probably not expecting me to address you like that. Well, you can ease your conscience of this burden it was maybe bearing-- I left this diary here on the altar for you to read."),
new dialog(Narrator, "As you read those words, I have finally decided that I have had enough. To you, it might sound strange, or gloomy, but don't fret: my race lives for very long, if not forever. But after a while, especially when living alongside shorter lived races, you start feeling like you have had your fill."),
new dialog(Narrator, "We have very peaceful deaths. We get plenty of time to prepare, to build, to say goodbye. Our graveyards are grandiose. When someone dies, nobody grieves them. For the grieving has been done when they were still alive."),
new dialog(Narrator, "This place is not only my tomb, but it has also been my garden and my office for a while. I infused it with my love for Terra. I carried plants accross the galaxy and gave them here the love and light and air they deserve."),
new dialog(Narrator, "Through this church I honor Terran beliefs-- although it is not representative of all of them, it was the beliefs of my friends whom I met on the planet. Maybe one day their civilization will develop, and their descendants will set foot in this church."),

new dialog(Bjorn, "Well played."),
new dialog(Narrator, "Yet, this place also holds a secret, as you surely know. I cannot control anymore how that secret will be used, but I do hope that this diary will be enough to convey my intentions. I don't want my name to become synonymous with conflict and pain."),

new dialog(Bjorn, "That's Swedish."),
new dialog(Narrator, "Alla är inte sanna nog för att höra sanningen, det är det sorgliga. Den kunde vara en bro mellan människa och människa - så länge den är frivillig, ja - så länge den ges som en gåva och tas emot som en gåva."),
