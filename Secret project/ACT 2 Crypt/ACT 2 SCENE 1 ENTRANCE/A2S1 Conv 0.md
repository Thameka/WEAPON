They should be able to retrieve a weapon that could well turn the tides for the ally nations of Terra and grant us victory over the Danish..."),

NarratorBjorn "After a silent, uneventful trip, Lussie and I both reached the floating crypt. From the outside, it looked like an antique church in the style of 19th century Western Europe. It seemed like a very unefficient way to design a building, but, yes, it was beautiful."

Narrator "We entered the crypt to be welcomed by a dark, more contemporary, neon-lit corridor. Everything was silent. It was making me feel a bit uncomfortable, but I could appreciate the quiet. Living in a spaceship comes with a constant background humming, the existence of which you tend to forget until it is finally not there anymore."

Lussie, "Ssssssso... Thisss is the crypt."

NarratorBjorn, "I couldn't help but sigh. Silence ruined. Some people seem to dislike shared stillness."
