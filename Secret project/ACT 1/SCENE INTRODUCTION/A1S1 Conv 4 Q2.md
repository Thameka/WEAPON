Thaléa : Unsure. We don’t really have traces of what the Necralis inhabitants were like. One thing is certain, though: trust was a prominent value in their culture, as a system. 
Beret: What do you mean?
Thaléa: All the tombs, mausoleums, and other constructions you see in there-- they’re open to everyone. It’s actually a problem. Surely we lost to pillagers many artifacts of the utmost importance to understand what happened here.
Thaléa : But we do know that Necralis has always been very peaceful. Maybe that’s why the only thing under lock in here is something that could be used as a weapon. 
Björn : Why is this the first time I’m hearing about this system? 
Thaléa: Necralis is very well-known in human sciences. But I guess that Terra feels uncomfortable teaching the History of a peaceful system without understanding how it achieved this kind of stability-- and what led to its destruction.
