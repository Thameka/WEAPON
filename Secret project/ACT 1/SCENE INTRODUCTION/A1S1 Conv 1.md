Coati : Captain! We are approaching our destination. 

Narrator : Lieutenant Coati is my esteemed right-hand and someone I absolutely trust. He has been serving the 3MP4-NADA for close to five years, and has managed to get us out of many hopeless situations.

Beret : Good. Reduce to half-impulse. Let’s get a closer look. 

Coati: … 
Coati : I can’t believe my eyes…

Beret: Chief of Security, do you detect any hostile presence? 

Björn : …
Björn : No hostile presence whatsoever, sir. We are alone.

Narrator: Chief of Security Björn is another crew member I absolutely trust. Although he started out as a simple technician, he gained my utmost respect for his loyalty, his cold tenacity, and his way of solving difficult issues in the middle of the most stressful situations.

Narrator : Since I’ve promoted him Chief of Security, we haven’t even run into the slightest perilous encounter…

Björn : But Sir, Captain… What even is all of this?... I’ve never seen anything like this.

Narrator : Gravity-less and made of shining processed stone-like materials far beyond our grasp of technology.

Beret: I can’t say I have ever seen anything even close to this in my entire life. I’d stake my beret on it.

Coati: Is that a cathedral drifting at the back ?!

?? (Thaléa) : The Floating Graveyard of Necralis.

Björn: The Floating… Wait. 

Björn : Who are you? What are you doing here?

Beret: Björn, don’t fret… I called her here. Thank you for coming, Thaléa.

Thaléa : The pleasure is mine, Captain Beret.

Narrator: This dramatic Finch is part of the new crew members I’ve had to welcome. She is to replace our former anthropologist who went to put her many years of experience of contact with alien cultures to the service of the Terran forces. 

Narrator : Thaléa is fresh out of university… Which means that she has a vivid mind and a great depth of current anthropological knowledge, but also a very high opinion of herself and a tendency to talk over-

Thaléa : My name is Thaléa, and I am the new anthropologist expert of the 3MP4-NADA. Nice to meet you all.
Björn : Nice to meet you, Thaléa. I am Björn, the Chief of Security. 

Coati: We have already met before-- I am Lieutenant Coati, as you know.

Beret: Thank you Thaléa. Now, can you-
