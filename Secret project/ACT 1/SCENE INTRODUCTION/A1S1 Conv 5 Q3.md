Thaléa : It was a star system lush with life. We don’t know how many unhabited planets existed within it, but at least six, for sure-- from what we could get from the graveyard’s tombstones. All races and nations coexisted peacefully. That’s about everything. 
Coati : If there were so many planets in the Necralis system, how come we didn’t pass any of them on our way here?
Björn : … 
Thaléa : They were destroyed. Probably exploded. 
Coati : What ?! How is that possible? All of them?!
Thaléa : Yes. Nobody has no idea why. This colossal drifting graveyard is all we have left of the necralian culture.
