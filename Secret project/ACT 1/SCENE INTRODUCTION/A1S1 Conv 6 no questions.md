Beret : Thaléa, thank you for shedding some light on this spectacular place and the secrets it holds. 
Thaléa : No problem, of course. Will that be everything?
Beret : Yes. You can return to your laboratory. 
Thaléa : Thank you, Captain. 

Narrator : As Thaléa exited the deck, I could have sworn that her eyes lingered a little bit longer on Björn-- completely unnoticed.

Björn : Thank you for the additional information. But, as I understood it, I am to explore a building in this graveyard. Could you give me more information about that?

Beret : Of course. As you know, the Danish seem to have detected the presence of a strategic weapon of considerable power in a mausoleum drifting in this graveyard. We aim to take advantage of our close location to the mark and take possession of it before they do.

Coati : I am actually going to accompany you.

Beret : Actually, Lieutenant, you will not. 

Coati : What do you mean?

Beret : I know I told you that you would, but I would like for you to stay with me and monitor the operation. After all, this is an unknown zone.

Coati : Ah… I see. 

Björn : If not Lieutenant Coati, who will be my acolyte?

Beret : You will go with Lussie.

Björn : Uhm... Ok. 

Narrator : I could see that Björn was not pleased. The sterner Björn becomes, the unhappier he is. And he was very stern. Lussie has been a crew member for some time, but they somehow never really got along.

Beret "It is decided then. We should arrive soon at our destination. You will explore a small... floating... crypt. I don't think there will be much protection around the artifact we are after.

Björn "Indeed, I can't find any kind of forcefield surrounding this crypt. Strange."

Coati "What a cute little crypt though."

Björn "Yes. It is very quaint."

Lussie "Ssssssso cute."

Beret "Ah! Lussie, there you are. Well, I think you can both get prepared. To the crypt! I should still be able to communicate with you by radio. Good luck."

Narrator "On those words, Björn and Lussie left the main deck, one looking significantly happier than the other. I went back to my station, ready to follow their adventure from afar."
