Captain’s Log, Stardate 42477.2.

Today, it has been 4 Terran years since the Danish War began. 

As no end to this conflict is in sight, I had to welcome onboard new recruits to join our Starship’s effort to give strategic advantage to the other non-Danish nations of Terra, as some of our more experienced crew members left the 3MP4-NADA to face our enemies head-on. 

Speaking of the devil…

The 3MP4-NADA has been diverted to the Necralis Star System. 

It seems that the name of a particular place of that Star System has been at the center of intercepted Danish conversations lately…

For holding a powerful weapon that could give a decisive advantage to the ones finding it.

Luckily, the 3MP4-NADA was drifting very close to the place in question. 

Our orders are to retrieve this dangerous weapon, study it, and protect it at all costs, until we can safely put it into the hands of the Terran War Council.
