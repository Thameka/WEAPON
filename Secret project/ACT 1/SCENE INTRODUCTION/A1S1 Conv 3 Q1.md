Björn : It is obviously a graveyard that floats.
Beret : Thank you Björn. But who is it for?
Thaléa : It is believed that this floating graveyard holds the artifacts --and… corpses-- of all the dozens of races that used to coexist in the Necralis system. 
Thaléa : It would probably be a bit preposterous to say that this was the only graveyard of the system, but… We certainly don’t have any traces of any other.
Thaléa : It is very cosmopolitan in appearance. You can clearly see wildly different architectures, although the material used is strangely homogenous across all the constructions.
Björn : What is this material, actually?
Thaléa : From what I know, something we don’t have on Terra. Something we don’t know much about… even across our interplanetary relations. But I don’t know. I didn’t study chemistry or physics.
Coati : What I don’t understand is… why is it floating? 
Thaléa : That’s a very good question. Why is this graveyard just drifting about? Several hypotheses exist-- maybe it was to honour the memory of the people who spent most of their life in space…
Thaléa : Maybe it all came to drift there after the explosion of a planet… 
Thaléa : Maybe it was some sort of custom? 
Thaléa : But in any case, nobody can answer our queries now.
